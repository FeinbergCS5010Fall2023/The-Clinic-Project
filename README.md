### About/Overview
The purpose of Milestone 4 was to create a graphical user interface with
the functionality that was developed from the previous three milestone
assignments. This was accomplished using java's JFrame library as well as
including features and functionality from java swing.



### List of Features
The features that are included with Milestone 4 include:
1. A welcome screen that contains instructions for starting the game and
   the developers of the game.
2. Load the text file directly from the GUI.
3. A visual of all the patients and staff members in their respected rooms.
4. The option to Register a patient.
5. The option to assign a clinical staff member to a patient.
6. The option to display a specific clinical patient's information/visit record.
7. The option to unassign a clinical staff member from a patient.
8. The option to discharge the patient.
9. The option to quit the game.
10. The option to assign a patient to a new room.
11. An about menu that contains the following:
    * Name of the clinic
    * Number of patients in the clinic
    * Number of active clinical staff members
    * Number of rooms

### How to Run




### How to Use the Program
When you run the JAR file, you will be greeted with the welcome page. From there,
you're going to click "file" from the menu on the top right and load in your clinic file.
Then you're be rediected to a visual representation of the clinic that conatins the patients
and clinical staff members in their respected rooms. At the menu, you have the option to preview
information about the room, refresh the room map, and the option to save lives. If you want to 
play the game, all the functionaliy is in the "save lives" tab of the menu. There are five 
actions you can do as the user:

1. Register a patient into the clinic.
2. Assign a clinical staff member to a patient.
3. Display the information/visit record of an existing patient.
4. Unassign a clinical staff member to a patient.
5. Discharge a patient from the clinic.

Furthermore, if you would like to move a patient to a new room, you can left click the 
room and click "add patient to room". If that room is available, that patient, along with
the clinical staff members assigned to them will be reassigned to that room.


### Example Runs

List any example runs that you have in res/ directory and provide a description of what each example represents or does. Make sure that your example runs are provided as *plain text files*.



### Design/Model Changes

Document what changes you have made from earlier designs. Why did you make those changes? Keep an on-going list using some form of versioning so it is clear when these changes occurred.



### Assumptions

List any assumptions that you made during program development and implementations. Be sure that these do not conflict with the requirements of the project.



### Limitations

What limitations exist in your program. This should include any requirements that were *not* implemented or were not working correctly (including something that might work some of the time).



### Citations

Be sure to cite your sources. A good guideline is if you take more than three lines of code from some source, you must include the information on where it came from. Citations should use proper [IEEE citation guidelines](https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE Citation Guidelines.pdf) and should include references (websites, papers, books, or other) for ***any site that you used to research a solution***. For websites, this includes name of website, title of the article, the url, and the date of retrieval**.** Citations should also include a qualitative description of what you used, and what you changed/contributed.
