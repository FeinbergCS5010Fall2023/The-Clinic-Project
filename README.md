### About/Overview
The purpose of Milestone 4 was to create a graphical user interface with
the functionality that was developed from the previous three milestone
assignments. This was accomplished using java's JFrame library as well as
including features and functionality from java swing.



### List of Features
The features that are included with Milestone 4 include:
1. A welcome screen that contains instructions for starting the game and
   the developers of the game.
2. Load the text file directly from the GUI.
3. A visual of all the patients and staff members in their respected rooms.
4. The option to Register a patient.
5. The option to assign a clinical staff member to a patient.
6. The option to display a specific clinical patient's information/visit record.
7. The option to unassign a clinical staff member from a patient.
8. The option to discharge the patient.
9. The option to quit the game.
10. The option to assign a patient to a new room.
11. An about menu that contains the following:
    * Name of the clinic
    * Number of patients in the clinic
    * Number of active clinical staff members
    * Number of rooms

### How to Run




### How to Use the Program
When you run the JAR file, you will be greeted with the welcome page. From there,
you're going to click "file" from the menu on the top right and load in your clinic file.
Then you're be rediected to a visual representation of the clinic that conatins the patients
and clinical staff members in their respected rooms. At the menu, you have the option to preview
information about the room, refresh the room map, and the option to save lives. If you want to 
play the game, all the functionaliy is in the "save lives" tab of the menu. There are five 
actions you can do as the user:

1. Register a patient into the clinic.
2. Assign a clinical staff member to a patient.
3. Display the information/visit record of an existing patient.
4. Unassign a clinical staff member to a patient.
5. Discharge a patient from the clinic.

Furthermore, if you would like to move a patient to a new room, you can left click the 
room and click "add patient to room". If that room is available, that patient, along with
the clinical staff members assigned to them will be reassigned to that room.


### Example Runs
Within the res/ folder is the example run that contains a .png of running through all of the methods that were implemented in this milestone. It demonstrates the following:
1. Register a patient into the clinic.
2. Assign a clinical staff member to a patient.
3. Display the information/visit record of an existing patient.
4. Unassign a clinical staff member to a patient.
5. Discharge a patient from the clinic.


### Design/Model Changes
The most significant design/model change involved displaying the clinic's room placement. We decided to replace Phil's design with Michael's design. The reason for this was because my design was not appearing in the format that we wanted it to, but Michael's design was so we added his design to the implementation.


### Assumptions

List any assumptions that you made during program development and implementations. Be sure that these do not conflict with the requirements of the project.



### Limitations

What limitations exist in your program. This should include any requirements that were *not* implemented or were not working correctly (including something that might work some of the time).
